# Progress Log — DevOps / CI-CD workstream

Rolling log for the `devops/` workstream only — separate from the repo-root `progress.md` on
purpose, so a product-coding session never has to load infra history into context. Read at the
**start** of every `/devops` session, updated at the **end**. Newest entry on top.

> **How to maintain (agent):**
> - **Session start:** read "Current state" below, then the latest 2–3 log entries.
> - **After each feature / session end:** update "Current state" and prepend a dated entry.
> - Reference features by their `devops/feature-list.json` id. Keep entries short: what changed,
>   what's next, and whether it's actually `verify`-green or still `blocked`.

## Current state

Planning complete (2026-08-18). `devops/feature-list.json` has 16 features across 4 tiers.
Nothing implemented yet — no Dockerfiles, no Terraform, no workflows exist. Tier 0's two
real-AWS items (`devops.terraform_networking_rds`, `devops.terraform_compute_envs`) are
`blocked` on AWS account access; everything else in Tier 0 is `failing` and unblocked (can
start any time — Dockerfiles and the OIDC/ECR Terraform don't need the RDS/EC2 items done
first, just don't let Tier 1 start before Tier 0 is fully `passing`).

## Log

### 2026-08-18 — workstream created, isolated from root context
Moved `devops-feature-list.json` from repo root into `devops/feature-list.json`, added
`devops/AGENTS.md` (scoped harness contract) + `devops/CLAUDE.md` (bridge) + this file, and a
`/devops` skill (`.claude/skills/devops/SKILL.md`) that dispatches the actual work to a
worktree-isolated subagent — so neither the devops context nor its work-in-progress ever
lands in a normal coding session. Root `AGENTS.md` trimmed to a one-line pointer. Next: pick up
`devops.dockerfile_api` or `devops.dockerfile_web` (Tier 0, unblocked, no AWS access needed).
